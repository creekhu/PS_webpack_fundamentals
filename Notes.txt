Why do we need a build?

1. Combining Files
    - bundling files to reduce number of HTTP request between HTML files and server
2. Minifying Files
3. Maintaining File Order
    - Reduce file dependency 
4. Transpilation
5. Linting 

Other Solutions

1. Server-Side Tools -> ASP.NET, Rails, and etc. 

Combine and minify JS and CSS, but cannot target other problems

2. Task Runners -> Grunt, Gulp, and etc.

Can generally solve the problem. For example: 

transiple -> output -> Linting -> output -> ...  -> browser 

Webpack Solution

1. Specialized in processing inout files into output files by using "loaders"
2. Can combine CSS, HTML fragments, Images, and Fonts into JS

Webpack conventions

1. Use npm not Bower
2. Use Module System (AMD, CommonJS, or ES6 modules)
